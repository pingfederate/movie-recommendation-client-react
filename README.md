# Movie Recommendation System

This project is a simple movie recommendation system implemented using React for the front-end. It utilizes a back-end API and a machine learning model for movie recommendations.

## Back-end API

The back-end API used in this project is available in the following repository:

[Movie Recommendation API](https://github.com/pingfederate/movie-recommendation-api)

The API is responsible for fetching movie data and providing recommendations based on user input. It serves as the backend for this front-end React application.

## Machine Learning Model

The machine learning model used for movie recommendations is available in the following repository:

[Movie Recommendation KNN Model](https://github.com/SpackiGabriel/movie-recomendation-knn)

This repository contains the code for training and deploying the k-nearest neighbors (KNN) model for movie recommendations. The API interacts with this model to provide accurate movie recommendations to users.
